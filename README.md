# Recipe Project - The Odin Project Foundations Course

The main project idea is put everything was being learned until now to work and build the html of a website with my favorite recipe. And, the Recipe I choose to use in this Project was Bolognese Pasta.

#### Skills learned and used in this project:

- Project structure learned so far with its pages and files.
- Creation of an HTML project containing head and body.
- Use of tags to create semantic HTML:
  - **h1** tag for the main title of each page.
  - **h2** tag for the subtopics of the pages.
  - **a** tag for the links.
    - **href** attribute where the relative link was added to the recipe pages and from them to the home page.
  - **img** tag for images.
    - **src** attribute where the path to the images folder and their respective images was added.
  - **figure** and **figcaption** tags to encompass the img tag following good practices and maintaining semantic HTML.
  - **ul** tag for unordered lists.
  - **ol** tag for ordered lists.
  - **li** tag for item contained in ul and ol tags.
